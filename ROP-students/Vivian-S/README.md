# Kidnapping at Robarts Game Level - Vivian Song

## Description

The files contained within this folder contain code for a Forensics Pursuit level based on the below scenario. The code structure itself is based on Nina's Level 1 Prototype. This level aims to evaluate the following forensics science concepts:

* Securing path of contamination 
* Finding latent evidence 
* Polyvinylsiloxane for pry/tool marks
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development using TapeGlo
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development using Camphor Smoke

## Scenario
A female student went missing a couple days ago and was last seen at Robarts Library, specifically in the Robarts Commons. Witnesses close to the student were asked to come in for questioning and sources close to the student claim the student was staying late studying for a chemistry exam and never returned home nor showed up for their exam.

## Update Log #1 - June 12, 2024

### Current Implementations

- Debrief with supervisor
  - Implemented basic dialogue containing debrief of the scenario and of tasks for the player.
  - Added preliminary evidence with draggable objects including the student's t-card, suspect file and student's planner (evidence will be updated to match the intended evidence pieces from flowchart depending on story).
- Implemented inventory toolbar
  - Designed a new toolbox/inventory system with new UI and look. Toolbox is now located in the corner of the player's screen at all times so they can pull it up whenever necessary.
  - When toolbox is clicked once, the user can open up their "inventory" and view their items and can also be closed/hidden.
  - Implemented 2 buttons for each hotbar item:
    - Inspect item - allows user to closely examine the item using a pop-up.
    - Pick-up item - allows user to pick-up the item from their inventory and use it to interact with other environment objects or with other inventory items.
- Basic navigation between scenes for path of contamination scene
  - Designed a navigation system that allows the user to click arrows on the ground to navigate to different locations rather than using arrow keys. 
- Path of contamination taping procedure completed
  - Player starts off with police tape in their inventory which they can use to tape off different areas.
  - Player can navigate left and right to corden off entrances into commons area.
  - Player can use the police tape and drag it to the dotted lines to tape off sections.

### Feedback/Game Fixes

- Try to narrow scope - combine objects to single forensics technique
- Simplify navigation and user interactions

### Future Development

- Add gloves interaction - player puts on gloves
- Redesign UI to make it more visually appealing and cleaner
- Take photos and replace current placeholder assets with actual asset
- Implement study room selection 
- Implement polyvinylsiloxane technique on study room door
- Fix inventory mechanics
- Implement lab procedures
  - TapeGlo
  - Camphor Smoke

# Robarts Theft Game Level - Vivian Song

## Description

The files contained within this folder contain code for a Forensics Pursuit level based on the below scenario. The code structure itself is based on Nina's Level 1 Prototype. This level aims to evaluate the following forensics science concepts:

* Path of contamination 
* Finding latent evidence 
* Oblique lighting 
* 2D Footprint development  
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development

## Scenario
A rare and valuable manuscript has been stolen from the second floor of the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library during a sophisticated heist that took place last night. The thief was able to hijack the security system, however, a couple witnesses who were closeby at the time of the theft were able to snap a couple pictures of the thief as he fled the scene.

## Notes

The following demo is meant to follow the structure of the above diagram and has only been completed up to Task 2. Future tasks and updates may be implemented in the future.
